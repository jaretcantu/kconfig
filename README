KCONFIG VERSION COMPARISON


This is a derivation of Kconfig (scripts/config in the Linux kernel source tree)
which provides version comparison functionality (greater/less than/or equal
to).  It is based on Kconfig from v5.10.


This functionality is designed for use with versions that have major and minor
numbers (or more), as opposed to theh vanilla kernel which only allows the
comparison of integers. The functionality presented herein will also work for
integer comparisons, but it will not work (the way you would expect, at least)
with floating-point numbers.

Each revision level of a version is taken as a separate integer comparison. The
comparisons continue until one of the levels is unequal or until there are no
more levels to compare.

Therefore, 3.9 < 3.14.

Also, 3.14 < 3.14.0 simply because it has more revision levels.

Versions may be separated with a number of different symbols: . - _


Only the changes from the C source files need to be included for this
functionality to be included in another project.  The rest is simply for testing
and building as part of an isolated tree.
